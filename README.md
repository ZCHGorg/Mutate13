## Introduction

This simulation uses the Pygame library to create a graphical representation of a population of fish with inheritable attributes. Fish interact by moving around, eating each other, mutating, and passing on attributes to their offspring.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ZCHGorg/Mutate13](https://github.com/ZCHGorg/Mutate13.git)
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd mutate13
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

Run the simulation script:

```bash
python mutate13.py
Use the following controls:

Close the window to exit the simulation.
Configuration
The simulation can be configured by modifying the parameters in the script:

width and height: Set the dimensions of the display window.
num_fish: Control the initial number of fish in the simulation.
attribute_library: Define the possible values for fish attributes during mutation.
