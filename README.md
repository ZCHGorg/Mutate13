## Introduction

This simulation uses the Pygame library to create a graphical representation of a population of fish with inheritable attributes. Fish interact by moving around, eating each other, mutating, and passing on attributes to their offspring.

## Installation

# Python Installation Guide

## Windows:

1. Visit the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest version of Python for Windows (usually a button labeled "Download Python x.x.x").
3. Run the installer executable.
4. **Important**: During the installation process, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python x.x to PATH." This will allow you to use Python from the Command Prompt.
5. Click "Install Now" and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
6. Open the Command Prompt and type `python` to check if Python is installed. You should see the Python interactive shell.

## macOS:

1. Open a web browser and visit the official Python website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest version of Python for macOS (usually a button labeled "Download Python x.x.x").
3. Run the installer package.
4. Follow the installation instructions.
5. Open the Terminal app and type `python3` to check if Python is installed. You should see the Python interactive shell.

## Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

1. Open the Terminal.
2. Run the following commands to update the package list and install Python:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3

3. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ZCHGorg/Mutate13](https://github.com/ZCHGorg/Mutate13.git)
    ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Mutate13
    ```

5. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

Run the simulation script:

```bash
python mutate13.py
Use the following controls:

Close the window to exit the simulation.
Configuration
The simulation can be configured by modifying the parameters in the script:

width and height: Set the dimensions of the display window.
num_fish: Control the initial number of fish in the simulation.
attribute_library: Define the possible values for fish attributes during mutation.
