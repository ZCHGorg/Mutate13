## Introduction

This simulation uses the Pygame library to create a graphical representation of a population of fish with inheritable attributes. Fish interact by moving around, eating each other, mutating, and passing on attributes to their offspring.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine
2. Windows:
Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download the latest version of Python for Windows (usually a button labeled "Download Python x.x.x").
Run the installer executable.
Important: During the installation process, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python x.x to PATH." This will allow you to use Python from the Command Prompt.
Click "Install Now" and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
Open the Command Prompt and type python to check if Python is installed. You should see the Python interactive shell.
macOS:
Open a web browser and visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download the latest version of Python for macOS (usually a button labeled "Download Python x.x.x").
Run the installer package.
Follow the installation instructions.
Open the Terminal app and type python3 to check if Python is installed. You should see the Python interactive shell.
Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
Open the Terminal.
Run the following commands to update the package list and install Python:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
After installation, you can run python3 in the Terminal to open the Python interactive shell.
Remember that the installation steps may vary slightly depending on the specific version of Python and your operating system. The key points are to download the installer from the official Python website and ensure that Python is added to your system's PATH during installation so that you can use it from the command line.

Once you have Python installed, you can proceed to set up your simulation according to the instructions in your README.md.
3. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ZCHGorg/Mutate13](https://github.com/ZCHGorg/Mutate13.git)
    ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Mutate13
    ```

5. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

Run the simulation script:

```bash
python mutate13.py
Use the following controls:

Close the window to exit the simulation.
Configuration
The simulation can be configured by modifying the parameters in the script:

width and height: Set the dimensions of the display window.
num_fish: Control the initial number of fish in the simulation.
attribute_library: Define the possible values for fish attributes during mutation.
